# git_improv

Hi all I'm creating this repository to do a improv session at lunch.
The idea is that you clone the repository to your terminal coping the ssh link from my github.
account (if you need more  info I leave you the link to the lesson  http://backend.turing.io/module1/lessons/git_and_github )
and write a single word at a time, in the file  ./lib/improv.rb, to create a history like we did in improv session.

After that commit the changes, push the file and generate a pull request.
